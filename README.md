###curve fitting with line, parabola, and 19th degree polynomial
Author: Arvin Nusalim

Abstruct: Given the data, we tried to find the local minimum and the parameter for that. Then we fix two of the parameters and sweep through values of the
other two parameters to generate a 2D loss (error) landscape. do this for every combinations. some of the data are used to train the model and the rest are used to test the model. The model are used are line, parabola, and 19th degree polynomial.
