## Analysis on 3 layer Feedforward Neural Network
Author: Arvin Nusalim. 

Abstruct: Given a dataset, use a certain amount of data as a training data to fit in a 3 layer Feedforward Neural Network to compute the least square error model and use the model to the rest of the data. Given a MNIST dataset, perform a PCA and fit it in a Feedforward Neural Network, then compare it with LSTM, SVM, and decision tree.

## I. Introduction and Overview.
This project's objective are to build a 3 layer Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) and fit it to the given data. First, we will use a 3-layer Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to perform a least square error regression on a portion of the dataset used as training data. The resulting model will then be used to predict the labels of the rest of the dataset. Next, we will perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the MNIST dataset to reduce its dimensionality and train the FFNN model using the reduced dataset. We will compare the performance of this FFNN model with other machine learning algorithms such as LSTM, SVM, and decision tree.
